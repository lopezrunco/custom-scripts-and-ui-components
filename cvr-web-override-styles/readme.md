## Centro Veterinario Regional web override styles

This file generates the necessary styles to override the default styles of the Centro Veterinario Regional website.

### Instructions:

### Step 1: Install SASS

Firstly, you need to have SASS installed on your system. You can install it via npm (Node.js Package Manager) by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
npm install -g sass
```

This command installs SASS globally on your machine.

### Step 2: Compile SASS to CSS

Use the `sass` command followed by the input SASS file path and the desired output CSS file path. Navigate to the directory containing your SASS file(s) in the terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
sass input.scss output.css
```

Replace `input.scss` with the actual name of your SASS file and `output.css` with the desired name for your compiled CSS file.
