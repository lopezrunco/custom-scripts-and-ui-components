## Input with mask

This JavaScript script serves to handle input for credit card information fields (card number, expiration date, and CVV) in a web form. It employs event listeners to track keystrokes in the specified input fields (inputCard, inputDate, inputCVV). The primary purpose is to enforce specific formatting rules for the entered data using masks (maskNumber, maskDate, maskCVV).
